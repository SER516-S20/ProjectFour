## Sprint Review
- What did we do?
  - Fixed existing bugs from previous Project/Sprint
  - Completed all the product backlog items
  - Finished the basic features ahead of the deadline
- What could be better?
  - Application could have been optimized more for better performance
  - Team communication
- What will we do?
  - Extensively test our application for bugs
  - Fix any bugs if found during testing

## Sprint Retrospective
- What did we do well?
  - Worked on the project design and structure before starting to code
  - GUI looks pretty good
  - Followed good coding standards
  - Used appropriate design patterns
  - Proper code cleaning was done and good coding structure was maintained
- What should we have done better?
  - Could have increased the performance of the application
  - Lack of planning lead to some rework during the sprint
  - Knowledge acquisition's estimation
- What should we start doing?
  - Should start using multithreading for better performance
  - Assigning related user stories to same person
  - Assigning user stories depending on the expertise of the person
  - Better estimation for each task
- What should we stop doing?
  - Starting to code before knowledge acquisition
  - Reworking on the same thing for efficiency too early before integration
- What should we keep doing?
  - Code clean up and unit testing after each major task
  - Applying appropriate design principles 
  - Try to increase the performance of the application
